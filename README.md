AzurTriCamp.com Source code!

This is a Website that I built for two businesswomen that decided to start a Triathlon training camp.
It is only about half finished because they have busy lives and they have not given me the content 
yet for the rest of the Website.

I started from a bootstrap template and then hacked it up and rearranged it and went from there.

This site runs on SpringMVC on a Tomcat server.
The contact form operates by sending a post with all the necessary info to FormSpree.com who
 then forwards the info in an email, for some reason one of the dependencies so operate the 
 contact form directly has been causing problems, not just for me but other SPRING users as well.
